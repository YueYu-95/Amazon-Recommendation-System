# Amazon Video Games Rcommendation System

## Business Understanding 
In order to enhance the customer’s shopping experience, the online shopping sites usually have their own recommendation system to personalize each customer's shopping experience. Same as Amazon, as one of the biggest online retailers, Amazon has large number of products and variety of shopping categories. Hence, recommendation system becomes a powerful tool that can guide customers to the potential products they are looking for in a time saving way. Just like people who want to shop video games on Amazon, a good recommendation system could guide customers to their potentially interested games among thousands of products in a quick and easy way. Besides, Amazon’s variety of product categories can provide customers more than just games, but also accessories. For example, customers may also need a controller or headphone.  We could deploy the recommendation system at checkout page as a reminder and motive customers to purchase more. Hence, a great recommendation system could make Amazon to be a one-stop shop for every gamer.

## Data Overview
The data I used for the project is originally from Amazon.com and collected by department of computer science from UCSD. Due to the large size of the datasets, I’m not able to upload my data to this GitHub repository, but [here](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/index_2014.html) is the link to access the data I used (The latest version data link was down at the time when editing this README. I'll keep tracking the link and push the right link when it back to work) The dataset contains user review from May 1996 to Oct 2018 and each item have at least 5 reviews (5-core). Plus, a metadata includes descriptions, price, sales-rank, brand info of video games.
